• Consumables Expanded - Mod that adds 20+ more foods, drinks and other consumables. All additions are in the same style as the base game and will fit seemlessly alongside all of the existing consumables in the game, no out of place icons or unbalanced buffs. All candy icons have been retextured to look more interesting as well. No other food mods should be needed with this enabled.

• Books Expanded - Mod that adds 20+ more foods, drinks and other consumables. All additions are in the same style as the base game and will fit seemlessly alongside all of the existing consumables in the game, no out of place icons or unbalanced buffs.
